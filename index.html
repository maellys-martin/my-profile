        <h2>Music 🎶</h2>
        <p>
          I am passionate about music. Whether it's French rap or US rap, my screen time on my phone is largely due to my use of Deezer haha. I'm the kind of person who always has my headphones on; as a hobby, but also as a necessity when I'm studying/working, tidying up, and even sleeping! I can't sleep without music in my ears :)

        <h2>Sport 🥋🏊‍♀️</h2>
        <p>
          I've always done sports. It started with ballet at the age of 3, then 2 years later my heart fell for a sport that is not the least bit different; taekwondo. I don't know if you know this Korean martial art and combat sport, but it is by far the best in my eyes. I practised it for 10 years like swimming, having to stop both because of a health crisis unfortunately... I can't wait to take it up again!

        <h2>Fashion</h2>
        <p>
         Fashion is something I enjoy very much and is literally part of my daily life. You may think "like everyone else", or at least like many girls. But I think it's a kind of entertainment that I enjoy and that allows me to escape. That is to say, I really enjoy making outfits, looking for new pieces all the time and keeping an eye out for new releases. Let's just say that it takes a lot of my time, and a lot of money too...

        <h2>Travel ✈️</h2>
        <p>
          I am a big fan of discovering new cultures. I am very curious and my travels have allowed me to broaden my mind. Apart from France, my country of origin, I have visited England, whose culture fascinates me, the Netherlands, Spain, Greece, Morocco, Tunisia and the United States. This curiosity is also focused on Asia, particularly Korean culture through taekwondo, Japanese culture through anime, which I am a fan of, as well as Chinese, which I decided to learn as my fourth modern language this year. To discover even more about Asia, Singapore will welcome me from next January for an intercampus mobility, I can't wait!

        <p>
        When I was little I wanted to be a vet for a long time, like a lot of kids haha. Thanks to this passion, I managed to get a dog and two turtles!
